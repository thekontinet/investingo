            <h2>2. Market Risks</h2>
            <p>Financial markets are subject to various risks, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Market volatility: Prices of financial instruments can fluctuate unpredictably due to factors such
                    as
                    economic conditions, geopolitical events, and changes in investor sentiment.</li>
                <li>Liquidity risk: Some assets may be difficult to buy or sell at desired prices, leading to potential
                    losses or delays in executing trades.</li>
                <li>Interest rate risk: Changes in interest rates can affect the value of fixed-income securities, such
                    as
                    bonds and certificates of deposit.</li>
                <li>Foreign exchange risk: Investments denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in
                    exchange rates.</li>

            <h2>3. Investment Strategy Risks</h2>
            <p>Investment strategies employed by Investia may also entail specific risks, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Concentration risk: Certain investment strategies may concentrate holdings in specific sectors,
                    industries, or asset classes, increasing exposure to risks associated with those areas.</li>
                <li>Leverage risk: The use of leverage or borrowed funds to amplify investment returns can also magnify
                    losses in the event of adverse market movements.</li>
                <li>Managerial risk: The success of investment strategies may depend on the skill and judgment of
                    investment
                    managers, whose decisions may not always produce favorable outcomes.</li>
