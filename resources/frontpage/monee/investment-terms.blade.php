                be under any duty to furnish the Client with any research report. Such research shall not
                constitute an offer on the part of {{ $appSettings->name }} to trade in any investment which may
                be the subject of any research report, and any such research report shall not constitute any
                specific advice to the Client regarding the merits or demerits of any investment mentioned

            <li>The services provided by {{ $appSettings->name }} to the Client under these Terms and Conditions
                shall not give rise to any fiduciary or equitable duties on {{ $appSettings->name }} part or on
                the part of {{ $appSettings->name }} Associated Companies which would prevent or hinder
                {{ $appSettings->name }} or any Associated Company in doing business with the Client as provided
                under these Terms and Conditions.</li>
            <li>When {{ $appSettings->name }} gives the Client investment advice, {{ $appSettings->name }} or any
                of its Associated Companies or any other person connected with {{ $appSettings->name }}, may have
                an interest, relationship or arrangement that is material in relation to the service
                provided.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>{{ $appSettings->name }} or any of its Associated Companies may have material interests in, or
                conflicts of duty in relation to, any transaction effected with or for the Client. Without
                limiting the generality of the foregoing, such conflicting interests or duties arise from:</li>
        </ol>
        <p>(a) effecting, arranging or advising in relation to investments where {{ $appSettings->name }} or an
            Associated Company has a holding, dealing or market making position or otherwise trades in that
            investment;</p>
        <p>(b) advising in relation to investments in which an Associated Company has underwritten, managed or
            arranged an offer for sale, issue or takeover during the preceding twelve months;</p>
        <p>(c) advising in relation to investments issued by any person to which {{ $appSettings->name }} or an
            Associated Company is or was manager, banker, adviser, trustee, or acting in any similar capacity;
        </p>
        <p>(d) effecting, arranging or advising in relation to investments where {{ $appSettings->name }} or an
            Associated Company benefits from a commission, fee, mark-up or mark-down payable otherwise than by
            the Client, or</p>
        <p>(e) effecting, arranging or advising in relation to investments in respect of which another client,
            or a client of an Associated Company has given {{ $appSettings->name }} instructions to buy or sell.
        </p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>All employees of {{ $appSettings->name }} and its Associated Companies, regardless of location,
                are required to comply with a policy of independence. This means that where
                {{ $appSettings->name }} or any such Associated company gives the Client investment advice or
                (where relevant) deals in the exercise of its discretion on the Client&rsquo;s behalf, although
                {{ $appSettings->name }} or one of its Associated Companies may have a material interest or (but
                for the previous paragraph) conflict of interest in relation to such advice or dealing, such
                employees are required to disregard any such interest.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>In the course of providing services to the Client, to the extent permitted by the ESFS Rules,
                {{ $appSettings->name }} may pay a fee or commission or a non-monetary benefit to any other
                person where the payment or benefit is designed to enhance the quality of the relevant service
                to the Client and does not impair compliance with {{ $appSettings->name }} duty to act honestly,
                fairly and professionally in accordance with the best interest of the Client and may receive
                minor non-monetary benefits from another person.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Minor non-monetary benefits may include information or materials relating to a financial
                instrument or investment service, participation in conferences and training events relating to
                the benefits and features of a specific financial instrument, hospitality of a De minimis amount
                and such other minor non-monetary benefits as are permissible under the ESFS Rules.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Telephone Recording</h4>
        <p>{{ $appSettings->name }} reserves the right to record telephone conversations with the Client and to
            retain such recordings and use the same as conclusive evidence relating to any transactions between
            the parties. {{ $appSettings->name }} recordings shall be and remain its sole property.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Client agrees that {{ $appSettings->name }} may deliver copies or transcripts of such recordings
            to any court or regulatory authority. Where {{ $appSettings->name }} executes an order on behalf of
            the Client, it shall provide such copies of transcripts produced in relation to such an order on
            request, to the extent required by the ESFS Rules.</p>

        <h4>Regulatory Provisions</h4>
        <p>Where {{ $appSettings->name }} has categorised the Client as a professional client or as an
            eligible counter party, the Client will lose some of the protections afforded to investors under
            the ESFS Rules. In particular, the Client may not benefit from the following protections:</p>
        <p>(a) the right to claim through the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS);</p>
        <p>(b) in the event of a dispute, access to the Financial Ombudsman Scheme; Eligible counter parties
            shall additionally lose the obligation on {{ $appSettings->name }} to act in accordance with the best
            interests of its Client when transmitting client orders to other entities for execution.&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Associated Companies are, however, required to comply with the regulatory regime relevant to
                them and a Client will therefore have the benefit of any applicable requirements under that
                regime.</li>
            <li>All formal complaints should in the first instance be made in writing to {{ $appSettings->name }}
                marked &ldquo;for the attention of the Compliance Officer&rdquo;. Clients of BourseDirect FR
                &amp; {{ $appSettings->name }} Europe(Lyon Branch) may further refer their complaint to the ESMA
                in the event that they are dissatisfied with the outcome of any complaints review undertaken by
                BourseDirect FR &amp; {{ $appSettings->name }} Europe(Lyon Branch).&nbsp;</li>
            <li>{{ $appSettings->name }} is authorised by the Client either during or after termination of these
                arrangements in relation to the Client&rsquo;s affairs to do or disclose anything required to be
                done or disclosed by {{ $appSettings->name }} or anything it is requested to do or disclose by
                any law in any part of the world or under the rules of the ESFS or any other body having any
                regulatory or enforcement responsibility in relation to {{ $appSettings->name }} business or any
                investment business.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>{{ $appSettings->name }} shall not be required to do anything which would in its opinion infringe
                any applicable regulations to which it is subject. {{ $appSettings->name }} may do whatever it
                considers necessary to comply with those regulations.</li>
